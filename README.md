# HL7 AU FHIR Test Data Utilities

This repository contains source code for command line utilities used to generate the FHIR JSON files and upload them to a FHIR Server. These tools are closely related  to [`au-fhir-test-data`](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data), a repository designed for the maintenance of a small example data set To demonstrate the functionality of the HL 7 AU standards.

There are three tools in this repository:

* `Csv2FhirMapping` expands comma separated value files into JSON FHIR resources. 
* `TestDataClient` uploads the values to a server 
* `xls-converter` converter adjusts some content of excel fields according to yields

State of the code:

* None of these tools at the current time have any automated tests.
* `Csv2FhirMapping` and `TestDataClient` have a Github-actions-based ci build, which publishes [Zip archives of release binaries on tag](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data-utils/releases) for arch arm/win and os linux/win.
* `xls-converter` has a Github-actions-based ci build, which publishes [Zip archives of release binaries on tag](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data-utils/releases) of the package.
